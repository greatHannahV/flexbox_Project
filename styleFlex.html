                                        Newt Scamander had a herd of Mooncalves
                                        in his suitcase during his visit to New
                                        York in 1926.He also kept another
                                        small group in the basement of his
                                        apartment. However, it is possible
                                        that these were part of the same herd.

                                        Creatures Reserve
                                        A Mooncalf lived in the Magical
                                        Creatures Reserve during the 1980s.
                                        Rubeus Hagrid brought it there after
                                        discovering it in a Muggle farmer's
                                        field. During the 1987â€“1988 school year,
                                        Jacob's sibling helped take care of it
                                        and discovered that it danced in a
                                        square pattern, different from most of
                                        its species, who danced with circular
                                        formations. The student theorised that
                                        it may have been ostracised from its
                                        original herd due to this unusual
                                        behaviour.

                                        With help from Professor McGonagall and
                                        Barnaby Lee, the student taught it to
                                        dance in circles, allowing it to be
                                        accepted into a Mooncalf herd that lived
                                        in the Forbidden Forest.
